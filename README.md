Bayesian Global Optimization for Minimum Energy Cluster Identification
======================================================================

This package contains examples of application of Bayesian Global Optimization
(BGO) to the identification of minimum energy clusters. The purpose of the code
is educational and, I presume, it is quite easy to break it.

Potential Energy of Arbitrary Clusters
--------------------------------------

We use the [Atomistic Simulations Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
 module for both the representation of clusters and the computation of their
energy.
